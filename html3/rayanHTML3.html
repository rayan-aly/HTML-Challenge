            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum

    Li-Fi (also written as LiFi) is a wireless communication technology which utilizes light to transmit data and position between devices. The term was first introduced by Harald Haas during a 2011 TEDGlobal talk in Edinburgh .
<br>
    In technical terms, Li-Fi is a light communication system that is capable of transmitting data at high speeds over the visible light, ultraviolet, and infrared spectrums. In its present state, only LED lamps can be used for the transmission of visible light.

<div class="CT"> Why is LiFi important?</div>
Consumption of wireless data increases by 60% every year. That means that the radio-frequency space is slowly becoming saturated which can lead to phenomenon called a spectrum crunch. Spectrum crunch refers to the potential lack of sufficient wireless frequency spectrum needed to support a growing number of consumer devices, along with various government and private sector uses of radio frequencies within a broad spectrum allocated for different types of wireless communications. This poses challenges with wireless networks because it would negatively affect the speed of our internet usage.
<br>
Eventually, WiFi will not be able to keep up with the demand of data.<br> <button> Read More</button>

    <div class="CT"> How close are we to using LiFi? </div>
    Itâ€™s been predicted that LiFi would be released to the general public in early 2022.
<br>
    A grocery store in France is currently using LiFi to track the locations of their customers throughout the store and is then able to offer coupons and incentives. Large mobile companies, such as Apple, are also starting to suggest that their future devices will be LiFi capable.
    <br>
    pureLiFi is currently working with partners across many industries including defense, healthcare, lighting, IT infrastructure, telcos, and device integrators. The company is also dedicating a lot of resource in the research for product development and commercialization.
