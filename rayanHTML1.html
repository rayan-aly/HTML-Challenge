   <i><h2>Q: What is 5G?</h2></i>
   <p id="def">
   <strong>A:</strong>  5G is the 5th generation mobile network. It is a new global wireless standard after 1G, 2G, 3G, and 4G networks.<br>
     5G enables a new kind of network that is designed to connect virtually everyone and everything together including machines, objects, and devices.<br>

    5G wireless technology is meant to deliver higher multi-Gbps peak data speeds, ultra low latency, more reliability, massive network capacity, increased availability, and a more uniform user experience to more users. <br>
    Higher performance and improved efficiency empower new user experiences and connects new industries.

  <i><h2>  Q: What are the differences between the previous generations of mobile networks and 5G?</h2></i> <br>
  <p id="dif">
  <strong>A:</strong>  The previous generations of mobile networks are 1G, 2G, 3G, and 4G.<br>
<ul>
<li>First generation - 1G<br>
1980s: 1G delivered analog voice.
</li>
<li>
Second generation - 2G<br>
Early 1990s: 2G introduced digital voice (e.g. CDMA- Code Division Multiple Access).
</li>
<li>
Third generation - 3G<br>
Early 2000s: 3G brought mobile data (e.g. CDMA2000).
</li>
<li>
Fourth generation - 4G LTE<br>
2010s: 4G LTE ushered in the era of mobile broadband.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
1G, 2G, 3G, and 4G all led to 5G, which is designed to provide more connectivity than was ever available before.<br>

5G is a unified, more capable air interface. It has been designed with an extended capacity to enable next-generation user experiences, empower new deployment models and deliver new services.<br>

With high speeds, superior reliability and negligible latency, 5G will expand the mobile ecosystem into new realms. 5G will impact every industry, making safer transportation, remote healthcare, precision agriculture, digitized logistics — and more — a reality . <br>

    <i> <h2>Q: What are the disadvantages of <b>5G</b></h2></i>
   <strong>A:</strong> 
    <ul>
        <li>
            Fifth-generation coverage works in waves, and in a manner similar to "Wifi“. The new coverage 5g cannot penetrate any obstacles , such as trees , walls even a piece of glass. So the line between the user and the transmitter must be direct.

        </li>
        <li>
            Upload speeds don’t match download speeds : The download speeds of 5G technology are incredibly high, in some cases up to 1.9Gbps. However, the upload speeds are rarely more than 100Mbps .

        </li>
        <li>
            5g does not work on all phones :Of course, it is awesome with super fast internet connections, but unfortunately not everyone can afford to invest in a new phone.

        </li>
        <li>
            When it comes to cellular devices connected to 5G, it seems the batteries are not able to operate for a significant period of time.

        </li>
